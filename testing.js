                    // However, if we search for "Sore Throat" (A-1) and click it,
                    // but we are currently in main menu.

                    // 1. Hide infoContent
                    // 2. Daddy (sel-box) gets place-left
                    // 3. Update titles
                    // 4. Show sub-page

                    // The issue: btn.closest(".sel-box") might be hidden.
                    // The existing code uses "main" variable which is #main-categories.
                    // If we click A-1, closest sel-box is #categoryA.
                    // It is not === main.

                    // Does it depend on #categoryA being visible?
                    // "daddy.classList.remove("selected"); daddy.classList.add("place-left")"
                    // If #categoryA was not selected/active, adding place-left is fine.

                    // But we might need to ensure main menu is moved away?
                    // The "main" var is global.
                    // If we are at main menu, main has "active".
                    // If we trigger A-1 click:
                    // It does: daddy (#categoryA) add place-left.
                    // But Main is still active? No.
                    // We need to make sure the view transitions correctly.

                    // Actually, if we just trigger the click, the JS handles "daddy".
                    // But it assumes we are navigating FROM "daddy".
                    // If we are at Main, and click A-1.
                    // Daddy is #categoryA.
