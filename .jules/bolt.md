## 2024-05-23 - Layout Thrashing in Initialization Loops
**Learning:** Using `innerText` inside a loop over ~150 DOM elements during `DOMContentLoaded` caused significant layout thrashing (forced reflows), blocking the main thread for ~70ms. This is because `innerText` requires the browser to calculate the layout to determine visibility.
**Action:** Prefer `textContent` over `innerText` when reading text from DOM elements in loops, especially during initialization, unless visibility awareness is explicitly required. Switching to `textContent` reduced the operation time to ~1.7ms (42x improvement).
